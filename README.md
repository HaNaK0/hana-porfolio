# Hana portfolio
this is my protfoliio written in rust using bevy.

## Motivation
I know that using bevy for a small protfolio is not really the corect tool. However I am not a web developer and therefore i don't need to show off my skills with web development 
however I am a gem developer which is why making my porfolio in a game engine makes sense. Also I did it just because i could.
